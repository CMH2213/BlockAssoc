<p>Hi Neighbors,</p>
<p>Have you completed your 2020 census yet?</p>
<p>It takes less than 10 minutes to do and gives our communities another 10 years. Please take this time while social distancing as well as encourage others to complete the census. April 1st is national Census day and every completed survey counts. Currently the numbers for NYC and Harlem residents is extremely low.</p>
