**I. FACE MASKS**   
Mayor Bill De Blasio asked all New Yorkers to wear a face covering when they go outside in the public. He cited research showing asymptomatic people could be spreading the virus without realizing it. "When you put on that face covering, you're protecting everyone else," he said.  As I said in my prior email,  **When you wear your mask, you protect me. When I wear my mask, I protect you**.

In total, 106 of the 204 people tested had a positive result. Note: Only a small number of people are tested, so the actual number of positive cases is much higher.
